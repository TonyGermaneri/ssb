# Notarise the signed bundles, staple the tickets, and package what comes out.
#
# Notarisation authenticates one of two ways, and which one you use depends on what Apple gave
# you rather than on preference:
#
#   App Store Connect API key   NOTARY_KEY_P8 / NOTARY_KEY_ID / NOTARY_ISSUER_ID
#     A .p8 downloaded once from App Store Connect. Preferred in CI: scoped to notarisation,
#     revocable on its own, and not tied to a person's Apple ID.
#
#   Apple ID + app-specific password   NOTARY_APPLE_ID / NOTARY_PASSWORD / NOTARY_TEAM_ID
#     The fallback, and what you already have if you have a developer account at all. The
#     password is an app-specific one from appleid.apple.com — never the account password.
#
# The API key wins if both are set. Signing (the .p12) and notarising are separate credentials
# for separate steps; having one does not give you the other.
