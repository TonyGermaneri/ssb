# Used unchanged by CI and by hand. CI imports a .p12 into a throwaway keychain first; locally
# your login keychain already holds the identity, so there is nothing to import and the same
# script does the same thing. That symmetry is the point — a signing path that only exists inside
# a workflow is a signing path you cannot debug.

# than one Developer ID Application certificate installed, discovery refuses to guess.

# Written for bash 3.2, which is the bash macOS ships and therefore the bash this will actually
# run under. No mapfile, no associative arrays, and every possibly-empty array expanded through
# the ${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"} idiom, because `set -u` treats an empty one as unset in 3.2.

# Two flags are not optional and are easy to leave off:
#
#   --options runtime  the hardened runtime. Notarisation rejects anything without it, and the
#                      rejection arrives twenty minutes later inside a JSON log.
#   --timestamp        a secure timestamp from Apple. Without one the signature stops verifying
#                      the day the certificate expires, rather than staying valid for what was
#                      signed while it was live. It needs network access, which is why signing
#                      offline appears to work and then does not.
#
# `entitlements` is optional and nothing passes one: the page's JavaScript runs in WebKit's own
# processes, not in ours, so the hardened runtime has nothing in SSB to object to. What the bundles
# do need is the hardened runtime itself, which is a codesign flag rather than an entitlement.
